# ðŸŒ€ Single-Phase Inverter Using SPWM (Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation)

## ðŸ“˜ Introduction

This embedded systems project demonstrates the implementation of a **Single-Phase Inverter** using **Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM)** on a **Texas Instruments C2000** microcontroller. The system is designed to generate PWM signals that replicate a sine waveform, suitable for driving a full-bridge or half-bridge inverter circuit.

The code structure uses modular design principles by splitting peripheral configuration and application logic. The PWM signals are generated by utilizing a precomputed sine table and are updated in real-time through timer interrupts.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Generate a sine-modulated PWM signal (SPWM) using a lookup table.
- Use CPU Timer interrupts for periodic updates to PWM registers.
- Configure GPIOs and PWM peripherals modularly using `Peripheral_Setup`.
- Demonstrate basic embedded signal generation for inverter applications.
